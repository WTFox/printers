# Ricoh

## About
Whenever my organization hires or fires someone, I have to go into each of our 5 printers and add/remove the user. This is often the step I forget to do, and it's definitely the one I like the least.

So I've written a python wrapper for dealing with these machines from Hell.

## Compatibility
This works on the following models:

xx01 series
* Ricoh Aficio MP C3001
* Ricoh Aficio MP C3501
* Ricoh Aficio MP C4501
* Ricoh Aficio MP C5501

xx02 series
* Ricoh Aficio MP C6502
* Ricoh Aficio MP 6002
* Ricoh Aficio MP 9002

xx03/xx04 series
* not tested yet

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WTFox/printers.git
cd printers
sudo python setup.py install
```

## Usage
```python
from printers import Ricoh

printer_conn = dict(
    host='10.10.2.13',
    username='admin',
    password=''
)

# Access via context manager so that all connections are closed automatically.
with Ricoh(**printer_conn) as ricoh:
    print(repr(ricoh))
    # <Ricoh(10.10.2.8)> at 51441168

    print(ricoh)
    # There are 94 users in 10.10.2.8

    print(len(ricoh))
    # 94

    for user in ricoh:
        print(user.id, user.name)
        # 1 John Doe
        # 2 Billy Bob
        # 3 ...

    # add a user
    ricoh.add_user(userid='jean', name='James Dean', displayName='James D', email='jdean@gmail.com')

    # delete user (by id)
    ricoh.delete_user(138)
```

## Disclaimer
Even though I've tested this thoroughly, I'm not responsible for any damage it may cause to your fickle, weak-blooded hounds of hell printers.
